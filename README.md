# FreeIPA Working

## Disclaimer

As of 2020-02-15 I'm running the following setup
- OS: Fedora 31
- Uname: Linux <hostname> 5.4.17-200.fc31.x86_64 #1 SMP Sat Feb 1 19:00:13 UTC 2020 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux
- IPA: VERSION: 4.8.4, API_VERSION: 2.235

A lot of these notes may be the wrong way to do things! I've previously mostly administrated Windows Active Directory domain and this is something that is fairly new to me. I'm more along the stages of "what works" right now instead of "what's the right way to do this?" Please keep this in mind when using any of my documentation.

## Summary

This is just a place to keep my personal notes for working with FreeIPA.
